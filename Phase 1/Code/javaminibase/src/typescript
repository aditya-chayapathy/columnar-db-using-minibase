Running Buffer Management tests....
Replacer: Clock


  Test 1 does a simple test of normal buffer manager operations:
  - Allocate a bunch of new pages
  - Write something on each one
  - Read that something back from each one
   (because we're buffering, this is where most of the writes happen)
  - Free the pages again
  Test 1 completed successfully.

  Test 2 exercises some illegal buffer manager operations:
  - Try to pin more pages than there are frames
*** Pinning too many pages
  --> Failed as expected 

  - Try to free a doubly-pinned page
*** Freeing a pinned page
  --> Failed as expected 

  - Try to unpin a page not in the buffer pool
*** Unpinning a page not in the buffer pool
  --> Failed as expected 

  Test 2 completed successfully.

  Test 3 exercises some of the internals of the buffer manager
  - Allocate and dirty some new pages, one at a time, and leave some pinned
  - Read the pages
  Test 3 completed successfully.

...Buffer Management tests completely successfully.

Running Disk Space Management tests....

Replacer: Clock


  Test 1 creates a new database and does some tests of normal operations:
  - Add some file entries
  - Allocate a run of pages
  - Write something on some of them
  - Deallocate the rest of them
  Test 1 completed successfully.

  Test 2 opens the database created in test 1 and does some further tests:
  - Delete some of the file entries
  - Look up file entries that should still be there
  - Read stuff back from pages we wrote in test 1
  Test 2 completed successfully.

  Test 3 tests for some error conditions:
  - Look up a deleted file entry
**** Looking up a deleted file entry
  --> Failed as expected 

  - Try to delete a deleted entry again
**** Delete a deleted file entry again
  --> Failed as expected 

  - Try to delete a nonexistent file entry
**** Deleting a nonexistent file entry
  --> Failed as expected 

  - Look up a nonexistent file entry
**** Looking up a nonexistent file entry
  --> Failed as expected 

  - Try to add a file entry that's already there
**** Adding a duplicate file entry
  --> Failed as expected 

  - Try to add a file entry whose name is too long
**** Adding a file entry with too long a name
  --> Failed as expected 

  - Try to allocate a run of pages that's too long 
**** Allocating a run that's too long
  --> Failed as expected 

  - Try to allocate a negative run of pages 
**** Allocating a negative run
  --> Failed as expected 

  - Try to deallocate a negative run of pages 
**** Deallocating a negative run
  --> Failed as expected 

  Test 3 completed successfully.

  Test 4 tests some boundary conditions.
    (These tests are very implementation-specific.)
  - Make sure no pages are pinned
  - Allocate all pages remaining after DB overhead is accounted for
  - Attempt to allocate one more page
**** Allocating one additional page
  --> Failed as expected 

  - Free some of the allocated pages
  - Allocate some of the just-freed pages
  - Free two continued run of the allocated pages
  - Allocate back number of pages equal to the just freed pages

  - Add enough file entries that the directory must surpass a page
  - Make sure that the directory has taken up an extra page: try to
    allocate more pages than should be available
**** Allocating more pages than are now available
   --> Failed as expected 

  - At this point, all pages should be claimed.  Try to allocateone more.
**** Allocating one more page than there is
   --> Failed as expected 

  - Free the last two pages: this tests a boundary condition in the space map.
  Test 4 completed successfully.

Running Heap File tests....

Replacer: Clock


  Test 1: Insert and scan fixed-size records

  - Create a heap file

  - Add 100 records to the file

  - Scan the records just inserted

  Test 1 completed successfully.


  Test 2: Delete fixed-size records

  - Open the same heap file as test 1

  - Delete half the records

  - Scan the remaining records

  Test 2 completed successfully.


  Test 3: Update fixed-size records

  - Open the same heap file as tests 1 and 2

  - Change the records

  - Check that the updates are really there

  Test 3 completed successfully.


  Test 4: Test some error conditions

  - Try to change the size of a record

**** Shortening a record
  --> Failed as expected 

**** Lengthening a record
  --> Failed as expected 

  - Try to insert a record that's too long

**** Inserting a too-long record
