First phase of the project

Due date: Sunday, February 4th (11:59pm)

This project will be performed and submitted by each student, individually. 
However, a single combined grade will be given to the entire group.


Tasks:
1) Copy the “minjava.tar.gz” file you can find at the Projects folder in the Blackboard site to *your* account in a Unix/Linux based system 
		-- preferably at general.asu.edu
2) Uncompress the file
3) Untar the file using the command
		tar -xvf minjava.tar
4) Modify the "Makefile"s to reflect your directory structure
5) In the "src" directory, build the source by running "make db"

6) Create the deliverable (assuming that you are using a Linux/Unix system):
6a) In the "src" directory, run the command "script"
6b) run "make test"
6c) In one of the tests, you will need to interact with the system.
6d) When tests are fully completed press "CTRL-D"

7) Submit the resulting "typescript" file and a short report that describes the content 
of each test at my.asu.edu. **It is important that you describe the tests using your words**
